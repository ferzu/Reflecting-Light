### Take a 10 minutes walk:
*By: JKphobic*

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

### Reflecting Light
*By: Tonylicoding*

Four mirrors are placed in a way that they form a rectangle with corners at coordinates (0, 0), (max_x, 0), (0, max_y), and (max_x, max_y). A light ray enters this rectangle through a hole at the position (0, 0) and moves at an angle of 45 degrees relative to the axes. Each time it hits one of the mirrors, it gets reflected. In the end, the light ray hits one of the rectangle's corners, and flies out. Your function must determine whether the exit point is either (0, 0) or (max_x, max_y). If it is either (0, 0) or (max_x, max_y), return True, and False otherwise.

Here is an image of the light being reflected:
